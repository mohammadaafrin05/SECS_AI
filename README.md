                                                        Self-Evolving AI Construction Planner

 Project Overview
The Self-Evolving AI Construction Planner is an AI-powered web application that generates optimized construction plans based on real-time factors such as workforce availability, material risks, weather conditions, and geotechnical risks.

Key Features:
1. AI-driven construction workflow optimization
2. Risk assessment & geotechnical analysis
3. AI-powered task allocation (Swarm Robotics)
4. Real-time weather integration via OpenWeather API
5. Automated budget estimation
6. Dynamic scheduling & workflow automation

Built using Flask, Python, OpenAI, and Web Technologies, this system helps project managers and engineers automate decision-making for complex construction projects.
